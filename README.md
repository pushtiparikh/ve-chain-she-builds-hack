# VE Chain - Decentralised Video Platform

## Problem Statment
Blockchain is a new and emerging technology in today's world and it has always been an inspiration for us to learn and develop something using new and emerging technology! Our website needs to be transparent, secure, and accessible to everyone.

So In our Ve Chain is a decentralized video uploading platform where users can upload their videos via blockchain and also tip other owners. Itâ€™s built on top of the polygon using graphql and we have used a file coin and IPFS. Our website serves as a platform for MetaMask users to connect their wallets to it and allows them to send ETH to other MetaMask users.

We will be focusing on deploying our web app properly and using our domain. We'd also like to add more functionality where user can see their transaction history!!

## Technologies we used
